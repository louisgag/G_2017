## MBDyn - Friction in joints
Friction is important in developing real world physical modules and simulations.  </br>
MBDyn is a multibody dynamics software with which you can create a module with initial conditions and its behaviour in certain physical conditions</br>
I would be working on improving existing friction model and implementing it in joints of the mechanical systems of 2 and 3 dimensions, this will include addition of frictional force in the right direction and hence changes in motion and trajectory are expected</br>
This contribution will help MBdyn it to cover more variety of physics problems and a better/ more accurate solution to the same
The challenges that I will face will be ranging from understanding the pre-existing code to actually coding in C++ and understanding the principles and mathematics behind the equations</br>
I intend to tackle the difficulties by getting the basics right and keep myself motivated to go deeper to understand the practices of coding. </br>
This will be done as a part of GSOC project by 5th september under the guidance of Mentors Prof Marco Morandini and Louis Gagnon
